# SmallGameProjects

Different small game projects and prototypes I've done over the last few years. Since most of them are quite old, only the source code is included (no commit history or extra files).

## Nahuel switch
Clone of the classic infinite runner game I did when I was in high school. The idea was to be able to play locally with as many people as possible, so every played had to use only one key. The maps were randomly generated using templates that were designed with [tilemap](https://www.mapeditor.org/).
