# SmallGameProjects

Different small game projects and prototypes I've done over the last few years. Since most of them are quite old, only the source code is included (no commit history or extra files). Project names below are in chronological order.

## Disconnect the worlds
My Ludum Dare 30 entry (48 hour gamejam). The theme was connected worlds, so I decided to make a game about closing a portal and disconnecting them. I did not have enough time to add sound effects or music, and the gameplay is a bit clunky, but it was fun to make! Fortunately, because it was  a LD entry, I still have the executable (for both linux and windows). You can play the game [here](https://gamejolt.com/games/disconnect-the-worlds/33102).

## Nahuel switch
Clone of the classic infinite runner game I did over the weekend when I was in high school. The idea was to be able to play locally with as many people as possible, so every played had to use only one key. The maps were randomly generated using templates that were designed with [tilemap](https://www.mapeditor.org/).
